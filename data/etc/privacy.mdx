# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ("Policy") outlines how Inner Ascend ("Inner Ascend," "we," "us," or "our") collects, protects, and uses personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User," "you," or "your") may provide through the Inner Ascend website or when participating in our ecovillage DAO and NFT-based governance system (collectively, "Platform"). This Policy explains your choices regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to companies or individuals outside of our ownership or control.

## Collection of Information

We collect information you provide when participating in the DAO, minting or trading NFTs, and accessing the Platform. This includes:
- Your email address for account access and communications
- Blockchain wallet addresses for NFT ownership and DAO participation
- Information required for identity verification (KYC) where applicable
- Community participation data and governance voting history

Additionally, when you visit the Platform, our servers automatically record information sent by your browser. This may include your device's IP address, browser type, operating system, language preferences, pages visited, time spent on pages, access times and dates, and other statistics.

## NFT Ownership and DAO Participation

All NFT minting and transactions are processed on the blockchain. Your wallet address and transaction history are publicly visible on the blockchain. NFT ownership grants you access rights and governance participation in the ecovillage DAO. The DAO's smart contracts and voting records are also publicly visible on the blockchain.

We use third-party services for NFT minting and blockchain interactions. These services may collect additional information according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their policies for complete understanding.

## Managing Information

You can update your Personal Information in your account settings. While blockchain transactions cannot be deleted due to their immutable nature, you may request deletion of off-chain Personal Information. Note that maintaining an email address is required for important DAO communications and governance participation.

Some information may remain in our records after deletion for legal compliance, dispute resolution, or enforcing agreements. After the retention period, Personal Information is deleted, but we may retain anonymized data for statistical purposes.

## Use of Information

Information collected may be used to:
- Facilitate DAO governance and voting
- Verify NFT ownership and access rights
- Process community participation
- Improve Platform functionality
- Send important communications about the DAO and ecovillage
- Comply with legal obligations
- Prevent abuse and maintain security

## Data Processing

We process Personal Information based on:
- Contractual obligations (NFT ownership and DAO participation)
- Legal compliance
- Legitimate interests in maintaining the Platform
- Your consent

## Information Transfer and Storage

While blockchain data is distributed globally by nature, your off-chain Personal Information may be transferred and stored in various jurisdictions. We implement appropriate security measures for such transfers.

## User Rights

You have rights regarding your off-chain Personal Information, including:
- Access and correction rights
- Data portability
- Processing restrictions
- Right to object to processing

Note that blockchain data, including wallet addresses and voting history, cannot be modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology.

To exercise these rights for off-chain data, contact us at [Your Contact Email]. These requests are free and will be addressed within one month.

## Privacy of Children

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. Parents should monitor children's Internet usage to enforce this Policy. If you believe a child under 13 has provided Personal Information, please contact us.

## Newsletters

You may voluntarily subscribe to our electronic newsletters, and can unsubscribe at any time. Transactional emails will continue.

## Cookies

The Platform uses cookies for a personalized experience. You can accept or decline cookies in your browser settings.

## Links to Other Websites

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites or third parties. Please review their privacy policies.

## Information Security

We maintain safeguards to protect your information, but cannot guarantee absolute security due to Internet limitations.

## Data Breach

In case of a data breach, we will take appropriate measures, including investigation, reporting, and notifying affected individuals if necessary.

## Legal Disclosure

We may disclose information if required or permitted by law, or during business transitions like mergers or acquisitions.

## Changes to Policy

We may modify this Policy at any time, effective upon posting on the Platform. Continued use of the Platform constitutes acceptance of changes.

## Acceptance of this Policy

By using the Platform, you acknowledge reading and agreeing to this Policy. If you disagree, do not use the Platform.
